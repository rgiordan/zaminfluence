\alias{GetWeightForTargetChangeRow}
\title{Get the weight vector for rows of the original dataset to achieve the change
given by a single row of a target change.}
\usage{
GetWeightForTargetChangeRow(
  influence_dfs,
  target_change,
  boolean = TRUE,
  rows_to_keep = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{influence_dfs}{A list of sorted influence dataframes as returned, e.g., by \code{\link[=SortAndAccumulate]{SortAndAccumulate()}}.  The list is expected to have results sorted for both negative and positive changes in both sign and signifiance.}

\item{target_change}{A single row of the target change dataframe produced
by \code{\link[=GetRegressionTargetChange]{GetRegressionTargetChange()}}.}

\item{boolean}{Optional.  If \code{TRUE}, return a boolean vector.  If \code{FALSE},
return a vector of integer indices.}

\item{rows_to_keep}{Optional.  If \code{TRUE}, return a vector of rows to keep
for the target level of alpha.  If \code{FALSE}, return a vector of rows to drop.}
}
